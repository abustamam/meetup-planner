This app is my project submission for the Senior Web Developer Nanodegree: Project 1: Meetup Event Planner.

## Features

- React/Flux
- Sass 

## Instructions for use

### The easy way

Visit my deployed site: http://abustamam.github.io/meetup-planner

### The hard way

- Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

- Run the server:

```
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your favorite web browser.

## To build
Run `npm run build` to tell Webpack that it is a production build. This will minify assets to prepare for deployment.
